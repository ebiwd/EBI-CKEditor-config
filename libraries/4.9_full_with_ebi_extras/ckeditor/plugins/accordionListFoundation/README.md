# Foundation Accordion List

This is a plugin that has been adapted from https://github.com/pkerspe/ckeditor-bootstrap-accordionList for Foundation 6.

## Original readme
A plugin for ckeditor to allow creation of bootstrap accordion list (grouped collapsible items).

This allows grouping of collapsible elements in a accordion list.
